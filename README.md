ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Priyanka Patel.
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and diving into the learning process. My goal here is to explore, experiment, and grow as a developer.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning java.
ğŸ“š I love solving puzzles and building cool apps.
âš¡ Fun fact: The term "debugging" originated from a literal bug! In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper and her team found an actual moth causing problems in the Harvard Mark II computer. They removed it and taped it to the logbook with the note: "First actual case of bug being found." The term "debugging" stuck from then on! ğŸª²
